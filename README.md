- 👋 Hi, I’m @wsullom
- 👀 I’m a retired Naval officer and retired IT system performanced monitoring technician.  I have used primarily scripting languages (JavaScript, VBScript, Visual Basic, Powershell) in my former employment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning gadget control with Arduino and small programming with Raspberry Pi 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate.  My programming is a means of recreation and keeping my synapses firing.  I am not experienced enough to be of use to the wizards that livwe on GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me: I would prefer not providing a means of direct communicaton.  If there is some way to communicate via GitHub, that would be OK.
